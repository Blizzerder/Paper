Introduction：
  WITH the rapid development of satellite sensors, remote sensing images have been widely used in various academic fields, and civil and military domains.
  从卫星空间图像引入
  However, as recognized by many, remote sensing sensors own the intrinsic tradeoff between spatial resolution and spectral resolution.
  提出卫星空间图像的空间分辨率和光谱分辨率两个重要要素
  As a result, for a certain remote sensing sensor, the captured gray panchromatic (PAN) images are generally with a finer resolution than multispectral (MS) images.
  引出PAN图像和MS图像的特点
  Typically, the goal of pan-sharpening is to integrate the texture details of the high-resolution (HR) PAN images with the spectral information from low-resolution (LR) MS images for the purpose of generating HR-MS images, therefore breaking the technological limits.
  介绍Pansharpening的任务：将PAN图像的纹理细节和MS图像的光谱信息聚合以生成HRMS图像，打破技术限制
  Given the above utility, pan-sharpening tasks are often regarded as a crucial preprocessing step for numerous remote sensing data applications, such as the extraction of urban impervious surfaces, land-cover classification, and change detection.
  说明Pansharpening任务的重要性
  
  Traditional pan-sharpening methods are generally based on handcrafted features, with limited capacity to reconstruct the missing information in the MS images.
  一句话介绍传统Pansharpening工作和限制
  More recently, numerous learning-based frameworks [6]–[8] have been proposed. These methods are able to learn a nonlinear mapping and high semantic features from a large number of paired images, significantly improving the performance and robustness of the pan-sharpening process.
  引出以深度学习为基础的方法并介绍其优势
  
  As the information from the PAN image and MS image is complimentary with a considerable amount of redundancy, building an efficient deep learning model with different specifications becomes a major focus of pan-sharpening tasks.
  介绍了Pansharpening的重要出发点：构建具有不同规格的高效学习模型
  Taking advantage of the MS/PAN image pairs, traditional deep learning-based pan-sharpening frameworks are summarized in Fig. 1. As displayed in Fig. 1(a), existing pan-sharpening methods [7], [9], [10] based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tend to view the input MS/PAN image pairs as a whole and aim to learn a mapping function from the concatenation of the LR-MS and PAN to the HR-MS image.
  介绍传统的深度学习网络方法：将LRMS图像和PAN图像拼接之后训练映射函数
  To make full use of the high-frequency information in the PAN image, another learning strategy is depicted in Fig. 1(b), where high-pass version PAN as the residual for information enhancement is employed [2], [11].
  提出了新的学习策略：采用高通版本作为信息增强的残差
  Despite the first-rate results achieved by these CNN-based methods, problems still remain to be solved. Inspired by deep learning-based image super-resolution, Fig. 1(a) presents a solution to cope with the texture generation, which reconstructs the image patch from the information within the small receptive area pixels.However, such a solution is unable to utilize global information in an effective manner from the HR-PAN space, leading to oversmoothing results.
  1a方法：根据小接受区域像素内的信息重建图像块，但是无法获取全局信息
  As for Fig. 1(b), directly learning the residual map from the PAN image tends to give rise to spectral distortion [11].
  1b方法：直接从PAN图像学习残差图会导致光谱失真
  To summarize, there are two major problems that remain to be solved: 1) how to effectively exploit the intrinsic relations between the PAN and MS images? And 2) how to deal with the spectral distortion phenomenon and obtain the high-fidelity, high-frequency information?
  总结当前方法的两个问题：有效利用PAN和MS图像的内在联系；处理频谱失真现象，获得高保真的高频信息。这也是论文的发力点
  
  To answer these questions and address the challenges in pan-sharpening tasks, we propose a novel dual-path fusion network (DPFN) that includes two global subnetworks (GSNs) and two local subnetworks (LSNs), as shown in Fig. 1(c).
  此段开始讲自己的方法：一种双路径融合网络DPFN，包括两个GSN和LSN
  The proposed DPFN aims to learn multiscale feature information progressively, leading to its state-of-the-art performance.
  总体介绍功能：逐步学习多尺度特征信息
  Inspired by the applications of the neighbor embedding model [6], a model that exploits HR patches in the PAN image and reconstructs these patches as a pan-sharpened image, we design a cross nonlocal block (CNL) to excavate long distance and cross space dependencies and aggregate these relevant patches to characterize the global information.The designed CNL can effectively reduce computational cost.
  设计了一个跨越的非局部块（CNL），目的是挖掘长距离和跨空间依赖，并聚合这些相关补丁来表征全局信息。可以降低计算成本
  Meanwhile, unlike existing works [2], [9] that take advantage of high-pass spatial information, we estimate local band-by-band residual components rather than all bands at the same time, aiming to exploit unique bandwise high-pass information.
  另一个创新点：同时估计局部逐带残差分量而不是所有频带
  More specifically, we design a novel high-pass modification block (HMB), where the special residual information is extracted via the spatial attention block, to adaptively learn fine-grained textural information. The learned global and local components are combined as the pan-sharpened image.
  介绍高通修改块，作用是提取特殊的残差信息，自适应地学习细粒度纹理信息
  In addition, we propose a near-infrared-VGG (NIR-VGG) loss to guide the network to focus on perceptual differences and generate visually pleasant results.
  提出近红外损失，产生视觉上更好的结果
  
  The main contributions of the proposed DPFN are given as follows.
  1) We propose an efficient DPFN for the pan-sharpening framework that learns the global and local information via the GSN and LSN, respectively. Both qualitative and quantitative results confirm that the proposed DPFN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
  贡献1：提出了一种用于全色锐化框架的DPFN，通过GSN和LSN学习全局和局部信息
  2) We propose a GSN to capture global textural and spectral information by integrating the neighbor embedding and residual blocks. HR texture information in the PAN space and spectral information in the MS space are fused to characterize the global contour. The proposed GSN is computational-friendly with less spatial and spectral distortion.
  贡献2：提出了GSN，通过集成相邻嵌入和残差块来捕获全局纹理和光谱信息
  3) We design an HMB to enhance the high-frequency spatial information in each band of the MS image. The corrected residual image can fully exploit the spatial prior of the PAN images, avoiding the problem of spectral distortion to a large extent. In addition, we use a perceptual loss to constrain the model in the NIR band. The feature maps in the perceptual domain play an essential role in restoring detailed texture information.
  贡献3：设计了HMB块提取高频信息，并引入了感知损失
